# Find My Jobs

This project is a simple React Native app that helps you find jobs on GitHub. It uses the GitHub Jobs API to search for jobs that match your criteria.

## How to use

To use the app, you will need to have React Native installed. Once you have React Native installed, you can run the app by typing the following command into a terminal:


npx react-native run-android


The app will ask you to enter a few search criteria, such as the location of the jobs, the type of jobs, and the keywords you are interested in. Once you have entered your search criteria, the app will start searching for jobs.

The app will display a list of the jobs that it finds. You can then view the details of each job by tapping on the job.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the app:

* Enter the location as "San Francisco"
* Enter the type of job as "Software Engineer"
* Enter the keywords as "Python" and "Django"

The app will search for jobs in San Francisco that are for Software Engineers and that contain the keywords "Python" and "Django". The app will then display a list of the jobs that it finds.
